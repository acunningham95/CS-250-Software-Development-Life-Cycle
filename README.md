# 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

# Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves understanding the user's desired outcome, as well as researching what technologies are available to achieve that outcome. 
# Creating "user stories" helps by breaking down the user's desired features into smaller chunks, and assigning each chunk with a priority level so that developers can quickly identify which tasks need to be completed first.

# 2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

# When developing programs, it is important to focus on creating high-quality code in a timely manner. 
# Agile processes such as Scrum or Kanban can be used to help organize and prioritize tasks, ensuring that products will be delivered in an efficient manner while still maintaining quality standards. 
# Other important considerations include testing, debugging, and refactoring code to ensure that it meets requirements and works properly.

# 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

# Being a good team member in software development involves collaboration, communication, problem solving, and respect for others. 
# It also involves being able to handle feedback from other team members and learning from mistakes in order to improve future development efforts. 
# Working together effectively is essential for successful product launches and meeting customer expectations.
